# Installation and Usage
If gulp is not installed on your computer, you will have to run this command:

```bash
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

Because we are using node, simply run this command next:
```bash
npm install
```

Now, it should be viewable by double-clicking on index.html inside of the src/ folder.

# Development
If you would like to make additions to this project make sure to run:

```bash
gulp watch
```

This ensures that any changes made anywhere are reflected correctly on the page.
